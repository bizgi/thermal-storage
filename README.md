# thermal-storage-tank

Data visualization tool for thermal stratification in hot water storge tanks. With this code it can be possible to
- plot temperature distribution along the storage tank heigh for various cases such as different inlet velocity, initial temperatures and flow times
- calculate and plot a couple of dimensionless numbers that are significant in the operation and performance of stratified sensible heat storage applications. Stratification, Richardson and Mix Numbers can be calculated with this code.
- compare two different data sets via various graphs

warning: messy code
